## EXPERIMENT NO.2
# MOS DIFFRENTIAL AMPLIFIER CIRCUITS
### 1. INTRODUCTION
  
  A MOSFET differential amplifier is a critical component in analog circuit design, designed to amplify the difference between two input signals while suppressing any common-mode signals (noise or interference that appears equally on both inputs). This unique property makes it highly effective in applications requiring precision and noise rejection, such as operational amplifiers, sensor signal conditioning, and communication systems. Unlike single-ended amplifiers, which amplify one input signal relative to ground, a differential amplifier enhances signal integrity by rejecting common-mode noise and interference. The circuit typically consists of two matched MOSFETs arranged symmetrically, sharing a common current source. The high input impedance and low output impedance of MOSFETs contribute to the amplifier's high gain, excellent linearity, and low power consumption. Modern designs often incorporate advanced configurations to improve performance further, making these amplifiers ideal for precision applications in fields like instrumentation, telecommunications, and integrated circuit design.

### 2. DIFFERENCE B/W MOS DIFFRENTIAL AMPLIFIER & SINGLE STAGE AMPLIFIER


|Feature | MOS Differential Amplifier | Single-Stage Amplifier |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| **Number of Inputs** | Two (Vin+ and Vin-) | One (Vin) |
| **Functionality** | Amplifies the difference between two inputs, rejecting common-mode signals | Amplifies a single input referenced to ground |
| **Common-Mode Rejection** | High (CMRR) | Low, amplifies noise along with the signal |
| **Gain** | Differential gain: `Ad = gm * RD` | Voltage gain: `Av = gm * RD` |
| **Symmetry** | Symmetric circuit design | Asymmetric operation |
| **Components** | Two MOSFETs, current source, load resistors (or active load) | Single MOSFET with a load resistor (or active load) |
| **Output** | Differential output (Vout+ and Vout-) | Single-ended output |
| **Applications** | Op-amps, instrumentation amplifiers, sensor interfaces | Audio amplifiers, RF amplifiers, signal boosters |
| **Noise Immunity** | High (common-mode rejection) | Low (prone to noise) |
| **Power Consumption** | Higher (due to dual transistors and biasing circuit) | Lower (single transistor) |
| **Coupling Capacitor** |Not commonly required because differential amplifiers inherently reject DC offsets and common-mode noise. The circuit operates with a stable biasing scheme without external DC blocking.|Essential at input and output to block DC components, prevent biasing shifts, and ensure proper AC signal transmission. Without coupling capacitors, DC bias levels from one stage could interfere with the next, leading to signal distortion or improper operation.|

### 3. AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT  

The aim of this experiment is to design, analyze, and simulate a **MOSFET differential amplifier** to understand its **operation, gain characteristics, and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR)**. Additionally, the experiment explores different differential amplifier configurations and their impact on performance by:  

1. **Using a Resistor as a Constant Current Source**  
   - Examining the basic differential pair with a simple resistive tail current.  

2. **Replacing the Source Resistor (Rss) with a Constant Current Source**  
   - Improving gain stability and CMRR.  

3. **Replacing the Current Source with an NMOS Transistor**  
   - Implementing an active current source for better performance.  

4. **Replacing the Load Resistors (Rd) with PMOS Transistors**  
   - Using an active load to enhance gain and differential output swing.  
   - In this configuration, all passive components (resistors) are replaced by MOSFETs, making the circuit fully active, improving gain, and increasing linearity.

#### DESIGN QUESTION:
**Design and Analyze the Differential Amplifier for the following specs. VDD = 2V , P <= 2.2mV , VICM = 1.2V , VOCM = 1.25V ,     VP = 0.4V.**

### 4. ANALYTICAL DESIGN APPROACH
GIVEN:<br>
VDD=2.2V <br>
P<=2.2mW <br>
VP=0.4V <br>
VICM=1.2V <br>
VOCM=1.25V <br>

The power of the overall circuit is given by,<br>
P = V*ISS <br>
ISS = P/VDD , 2.2m/2.2 = 1mA. <br>
ISS= 1mA. <br>

ISS= ID1 + ID2 <br>

Since ID1 and ùêºùê∑2 are equal in an ideal MOSFET differential amplifier due to symmetrical circuit design, identical transistor characteristics, and a constant tail current source ensuring equal current division.<br>
ID1 = ID2 =ISS/2 = 0.5mA.<br> 

designig RSS Value:<br>

RSS= VP/ISS = 0.4/1m = 0.4k ohm <br>

designig RD Value:<br>

RD= (VDD - VOCM)/ID1 <br>
  = (2.2-1.25)/0.5m<br>
RD= 1.9k ohm <br>
