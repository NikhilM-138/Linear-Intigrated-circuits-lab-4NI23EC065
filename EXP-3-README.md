## EXPAERIMENT NO.3
# CURRENT MIRRORING CIRCUITS
### 1.INTRODUCTION
A current mirror circuit is a fundamental building block in analog electronics, primarily used for current replication and biasing applications. It ensures that the output current closely follows a reference current, making it useful in integrated circuits (ICs), amplifiers, and active loads. Current mirrors are widely used due to their high output resistance, improved accuracy, and ability to maintain constant current independent of voltage variations. The experiment involves simulating different types of current mirror circuits, such as basic current mirrors, Wilson current mirrors, and cascode current mirrors, to analyze their performance, current transfer accuracy, and voltage dependencies. By understanding these circuits, engineers can design efficient current sources and biasing networks for various analog and mixed-signal applications.
